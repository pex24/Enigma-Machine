      This project is based on the Engima Machine used by the Germans in WW2
	            An Engima Machine contains a few basic parts:
	                A Plug Board, 3 Rotors and a Reflector
	  
	  
	  
	  The message would be typed into the machine and pass first through
	  the plug board and through each of the 3 rotors and then through the 
	  reflector. The message then passes back through the machine in the  
	  opposite order. This added more layers of complexity to the Engima Code
	               making it almost impossible to crack.
